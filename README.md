# Game Engine Design

The game engine design module aimed to teach students design patterns and common coding patterns found in game engines. It also taught students in depth inheritance found in C++ and common C++ advanced topics such as the standard template library or STL. 

## Assignment

The assignment was to develop a prototype game that showed off good use of modern C++ and design patterns. The goal was not to create an awesome game but merely show off the concepts tought in the module. Additionally a report was required to descrive the design and what features have been implemented along with a general report.
